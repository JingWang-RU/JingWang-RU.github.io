I have joined Amazon (retail and Amazon Web Services) for over 3 years. I have developed an end-to-end time-series forecasting system for the global retail business. Between 2019 to 2021, I mainly focus on natural language processing, search engine and recommendation service at AWS AI Labs which attract clients from various domains. 

Prior to joining Amazon, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Rutgers University, Cornell University and Mount Sinai between 2015 to 2019. I enjoy working in a diverse team with experts in Statistics, Biology and Cardiovascular technology.

I have spent two wonderful years at National University of Singapore when pursuing my Ph.D. degree.
