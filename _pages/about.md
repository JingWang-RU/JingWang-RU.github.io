I have joined Amazon (retail and Amazon Web Services) for over 3 years. I build an end-to-end time-series forecasting system for the global retail business. Between 2019 to 2021, I mainly focus on Natural language processing, search and recommendation system at AWS AI Labs which attracts many customers in various domains. 

Before joining Amazon, I have done research projects at Mount Sinai, Cornell University, and Rutgers University as a postdoc researcher between 2015 to 2019. There is a lot of fun to work with team members with diverse backgrounds, such as Statistics, Biology and Radiology.

I hold Ph.D. degree of computer science. During 3 years of my Ph.D. study, I have spent 2 wonderful years at National University of Singapore.
