I have joined Amazon (retail and Amazon Web Services) for over 3 years. I have developed an end-to-end time-series forecasting system for the global retail business. Between 2019 to 2021, I mainly focus on natural language processing, search engine and recommendation service at AWS AI Labs which attract clients from various domains. 

Before joining Amazon, I have done research projects at Mount Sinai, Cornell University, and Rutgers University as a postdoc researcher between 2015 to 2019. I enjoy working with team members with diverse backgrounds, such as statistics, biology and cardiovascular technology.

I have spent two wonderful years at National University of Singapore when pursuing my Ph.D. degree.
