I joined Amazon (Forecasting and Amazon Web Services) in 2019. At Forecasting team, I have developed an end-to-end time-series forecasting system for the global retail business. Between 2019 to 2021, I worked on natural language processing, search engine and recommendation service at AWS AI Labs. The high performance services attract clients from finance, media and retail. 

Prior to joining Amazon, I spent three years as a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Statistics in Rutgers University. From 2018 to 2019, I worked at the intersection of Healthcare and machine learning in Cornell Medical School and Icahn Genomics Institute. 

I have spent two years at National University of Singapore when pursuing my Ph.D. degree in computer science.
