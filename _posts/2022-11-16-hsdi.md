We drive 4 hours from NYC to the Harvard campus. The location of the conference is in Harvard University. But we stayed in the hotel next to the MIT campus. My friend Professor Christopher Musco gave me some recommendations about things to do near MIT.

The conference is hosted by Professor David C. Parkes. I met experts from AWS and other companies, such as Nelson Gonz&aacute lez, famous professors from multiple universities. The professors introduce their interesting works published in papers or reported by News. The interesting topics include utilizing AI to make fair decisions in human related experiments, AI helping Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing, and educating the public of Covid with Statistical Visualization.

The last panel provides the postdoctoral researchers at Harvard University the opportunity to introduce their works. Some of them have already offered faculty positions.
