Search is important, search is needed everywhere. I do not search myself when my friend gives me a recommend which saves me tons of time. I am interested to design a search engine with recommendation. 


Now there are so many recommendations online, e.g. reviews, discussions on Blind. People tend to make the decision based on public and recommendation. The public information is like search results returned by Google. The recommendation is the comment that received lots of likes on facebook, or reviews. In terms of route planning, public information from Google Maps maybe good enough. In terms of apartment searching for rent / buy, a real estate agent can help the process a little easier and less stressful sometimes. Because the brokers usually has more potential buyers and sellers.
