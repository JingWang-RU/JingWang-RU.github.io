Read Books about Investment

I read books such as One up on Wall Street, Security Analysis. Here are the information I find helpful.

1. When the rate is high, there are some stocks undervalued.

2. Earning is more important than stock price. 

3. If you want to make money, you must be smarter than managers that hold a large of stocks. Similarly, if you want to get your paper accepted, you must be better than reviewer, at least one of your co-authors is.
