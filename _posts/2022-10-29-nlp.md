Visual data are usually more attractive than text. But text is able to deliver more accurate information, easy to save, faster to retrieve. It is with practical interest to provide a summarization of the text information from an image, and translate the summarization to different languages. 

Here is a <a href="https://bccls.libcal.com/event/9771940?hs=a">poster</a> of a local event. It is interesting to extract event name, date and location in one sentence or in a table, then translate the table to multiple languages. 
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/halloween.png" title="example image" width="400" 
     height="500" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 center" heigth=800px %}
    </div>
</div>
