Search is important, search is needed everywhere. I do not search myself when my friend gives me a recommend which saves me tons of time. I am interested to design a search engine with recommendation. 


Now there are so many recommendations online, e.g. reviews, discussions on Blind. People tend to make the decision based on public and recommendation. The public information is like search results returned by Google. The recommendation is the comment that received lots of likes on facebook, or reviews. In term of routine search, public information from Google maybe good enough. In terms of domain services such as apartment search, a recommendation from a real estate agent is important. Because the real estate agent usually has a private knowledge base.
